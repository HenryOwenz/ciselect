## Architecture

cloudgate uses a dual-layer architecture:
- Provider layer: Abstracts cloud provider APIs
- UI layer: Handles user interaction and workflow

The application follows a modular design pattern that makes it easy to add new cloud services and operations. Each service is implemented as a separate module with clear interfaces, allowing for independent development and testing.
